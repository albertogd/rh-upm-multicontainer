= Create a multi-container application in Openshift

In this exercise, you will deploy the multi-container application with Apache and MySQL in Openshift.

[#create]
== Create a PHP application

**1) Go to Developer View. and then click on +Add. Select the project where MySQL was deployed. Then select From Git.**

Use the following parameters:

* Git Repo URL: https://github.com/albertogd/rh-upm-multicontainer.git
* Show Advanced Git Options
** Git Reference: master
** Context Dir: apps/multi-container

In Builder Image, select PHP

* Application: myhttp
* Name: myhttp

In Select the resource type to generate, choose **DeploymentConfig** 

Click on Deployment, and add the environment variables:

[cols="^60%,^40%" width="40%"]
|===
|NAME|VALUE 

|MYSQL_HOST
|mariadb

|MYSQL_USER
|user

|MMYSQL_PASSWORD
|rootpass

|MYSQL_DATABASE

**Go to Topology, select PHP, and then go to Resources. In the bottom you’ll find the application URL. Click on the URL, and cheek you’re able to access the application.**

[#delete]
== Delete the PHP application pod

**2) Go to Administrator, Workloads, Pods. Select the Apache pod, and Delete the pod. Wait around 1 minute, and then check again to access the application. Are you able to access? Why? **

After deleting the Pod, Openshift starts a new pod because the Apache application has a replication controller with a desired state of 1 pod.

When the pod was deleted, the replication controller created another pod to get the desired state of 1 pod.

[#ha]
**3) Now you must ensure High Availability in our application. The application must be always available (not even 1 minute of downtime) if one Apache pod is removed. Do you think of a way to ensure HA in the web application?**

Scale up the application to 2 replicas. This way, the application will be always available even if a pod is removed.

Go to the DeploymentConfig, and click on the ^ arrow. It’ll scale the application to 2 replicas, and will create another pod.

If one pod is destroyed, the application will continue working using the other pod.
